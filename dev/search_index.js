It is extended by Dispersal.jl for modelling organism dispersal processes.\n\n(Image: Dispersal quarantine)\n\nA dispersal simulation with quarantine interactions, using Dispersal.jl, custom rules and the  GtkOuput from DynamicGridsGtk.  Note that this is indicative of the real-time frame-rate on a laptop.\n\nA DynamicGrids.jl simulation is run with a script like this one running the included game of life model Life():\n\nusing DynamicGrids, Crayons\n\ninit = rand(Bool, 150, 200)\noutput = REPLOutput(init; tspan=1:200, fps=30, color=Crayon(foreground=:red, background=:black, bold=true))\nsim!(output, Life())\n\n(Image: REPL life)\n\nA game of life simulation being displayed directly in a terminal.\n\nConcepts\n\nThe framework is highly customisable, but there are some central ideas that define how a simulation works: grids, rules, and outputs.\n\nGrids\n\nSimulation grids may be any single AbstractArray or a NamedTuple of multiple AbstractArray. Grids are updated by Rules that are run for every cell, at every timestep.\n\nThe init grid/s contain whatever initialisation data is required to start a simulation: the array type, size and element type, as well as providing the initial conditions:\n\ninit = rand(Float32, 100, 100)\n\nAn init grid can be attached to an Output: \n\noutput = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:100)\n\nor passed into a simulation, where it will take preference over the init attached to the Output, but must be the same type and size:\n\nsim!(output, ruleset; init=init)\n\nFor multiple grids, init is a NamedTuple of equal-sized arrays matching the names given to each Ruleset :\n\ninit = (predator=rand(100, 100), prey=(rand(100, 100))\n\nHandling and passing of the correct grids to a Rule is automated by DynamicGrids.jl. Rules specify which grids they require in what order using the first two (R and W) type parameters, or read and write keyword arguments. \n\nDimensional or spatial init grids from DimensionalData.jl of GeoData.jl will propagate through the model to return output with explicit dimensions. This will plot correctly as a map using Plots.jl, to which shape files and observation points can be easily added.\n\nRules\n\nRules hold the parameters for running a simulation, and are applied in applyrule method that is called for each of the active cells in the grid. Rules come in a number of flavours (outlined in the docs), which allow assumptions to be made about running them that can greatly improve performance. Rules can be collected in a Ruleset, with some additional arguments to control the simulation:\n\nruleset = Ruleset(Life(2, 3); opt=SparseOpt())\n\nMultiple rules can be combined in a Ruleset. Each rule will be run for the whole grid, in sequence, using appropriate optimisations depending on the parent types of each rule:\n\nruleset = Ruleset(rule1, rule2; timestep=Day(1), opt=SparseOpt())\n\nFor better performance (often ~2x or more), models included in a Chain object will be combined into a single model, using only one array read and write. This optimisation is limited to CellRule, or a NeighborhoodRule followed by CellRule. If the @inline compiler macro is used on all applyrule methods, all rules in a Chain will be compiled together into a single, efficient function call.\n\nruleset = Ruleset(rule1, Chain(rule2, rule3, rule4))\n\nOutput\n\nOutputs are ways of storing or viewing a simulation. They can be used interchangeably depending on your needs: ArrayOutput is a simple storage structure for high performance-simulations. As with most outputs, it is initialised with the init array, but in this case it also requires the number of simulation frames to preallocate before the simulation runs.\n\noutput = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:10)\n\nThe REPLOutput shown above is a GraphicOutput that can be useful for checking a simulation when working in a terminal or over ssh:\n\noutput = REPLOutput(init; tspan=1:100)\n\nImageOutput is the most complex class of outputs, allowing full color visual simulations using ColorSchemes.jl. It can also display multiple grids using color  composites or layouts, as shown above in the quarantine simulation.\n\nDynamicGridsInteract.jl provides simulation interfaces for use in Juno, Jupyter, web pages or electron apps, with live interactive control over parameters. DynamicGridsGtk.jl is a simple graphical output for Gtk. These packages are kept separate to avoid dependencies when being used in non-graphical simulations. \n\nOutputs are also easy to write, and high performance applications may benefit from writing a custom output to reduce memory use. Performance of DynamicGrids.jl is dominated by cache interactions, so reducing memory use has positive effects.\n\nExample\n\nThis example implements a very simple forest fire model:\n\nusing DynamicGrids, DynamicGridsGtk, ColorSchemes, Colors\n\nconst DEAD, ALIVE, BURNING = 1, 2, 3\n\nrule = let prob_combustion=0.0001, prob_regrowth=0.01\n    Neighbors(RadialNeighborhood(1)) do neighborhood, cell\n        if cell == ALIVE\n            if BURNING in neighborhood\n                BURNING\n            else\n                rand() <= prob_combustion ? BURNING : ALIVE\n            end\n        elseif cell in BURNING\n            DEAD\n        else\n            rand() <= prob_regrowth ? ALIVE : DEAD\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Set up the init array and output (using a Gtk window)\ninit = fill(ALIVE, 400, 400)\nprocessor = ColorProcessor(scheme=ColorSchemes.rainbow, zerocolor=RGB24(0.0))\noutput = GtkOutput(init; tspan=1:200, fps=25, minval=DEAD, maxval=BURNING, processor=processor)\n\n# Run the simulation\nsim!(output, rule)\n\n# Save the output as a gif\nsavegif(\"forestfire.gif\", output)\n\n(Image: forestfire)\n\nTiming the simulation for 200 steps, the performance is quite good:\n\noutput = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:200)\n@time sim!(output, ruleset)\n 1.384755 seconds (640 allocations: 2.569 MiB)\n\nAlternatives\n\nAgents.jl can also do cellular-automata style simulations. The design of Agents.jl is to iterate over a list of agents, instead of broadcasting over an array of cells. This approach is well suited to when you need to track the movement and details about individual agents throughout the simulation. \n\nHowever, for simple grid models where you don't need to track individuals, like the forest fire model above, DynamicGrids.jl is two orders of magnitude faster than Agents.jl, and provides better visualisation tools. If you are doing grid-based simulation and you don't need to track individual agents, DynamicGrids.jl is probably the best tool. For other use cases, try Agents.jl.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Running-simulations","page":"DynamicGrids.jl","title":"Running simulations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"DynamicGrids.jl","title":"DynamicGrids.jl","text":"sim!\nresume!
