    Neighborhood

Neighborhoods define the pattern of surrounding cells in the "neighborhood"
of the current cell. The `neighbors` function returns the surrounding
cells as an iterable.

The main kinds of neighborhood are demonstrated below:

![Neighborhoods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesaraustralia/DynamicGrids.jl/media/Neighborhoods.png)

Neighborhoods can be used in [`NeighborhoodRule`](@ref) and [`SetNeighborhoodRule`](@ref) -
the same shapes with different purposes. In a `NeighborhoodRule` the neighborhood specifies
which cells around the current cell are returned as an iterable from the `neighbors` function. 
These can be counted, summed, compared, or multiplied with a kernel in an 
`AbstractKernelNeighborhood`, using [`kernelproduct`](@ref).

In `SetNeighborhoodRule` neighborhoods give the locations of cells around the central cell,
as [`offsets`] and absolute [`positions`](@ref) around the index of each neighbor. These
can then be written to manually.
