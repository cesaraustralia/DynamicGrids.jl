    Rule

A `Rule` object contains the information required to apply an
`applyrule` method to every cell of every timestep of a simulation.

Rules are applied to the grid using the [`applyrule`](@ref) method:

```julia
@inline applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourRule, state, index) = ...
```

Where `index` is a `Tuple` of `Int`, and `state` is a single value, or a `NamedTuple`
if multiple grids are requested. the [`SimData`](@ref) object can be used to access current 
timestep and other simulation data and metadata.

Rules can be updated from the original rule before each timestep, in [`modifyrule`](@ref):

```julia
modifyrule(rule::YourRule, data::SimData) = ...
```

Rules can also be run in sequence, often wrapped in a `Tuple` or [`Ruleset`](@ref)s.

DynamicGrids guarantees that:

- `modifyrule` is run once for every rule for every timestep. 
    The result is passed to `applyrule`, but not retained after that.
- `applyrule` is run once for every rule, for every cell, for every timestep, unless an 
    optimisation like `SparseOpt` is enable to skips empty cells.
- the output of running a rule for any cell does not affect the input of the 
    same rule running anywhere else in the grid.
- rules later in the sequence are passed grid state updated by the earlier rules.
- masked areas and wrapped or removed boundary regions are updated between all rules and timesteps

## Multiple grids

The `NamedTuple` keys will match the keys in `R`, which is a type like `Tuple{:key1,:key1}`.
Note the names are user-specified, and should never be fixed by a `Rule`. 

They can be retrieved from the type here as `A` and `B` :

```julia
applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourCellRule{Tuple{R1,R2},Tuple{W1,W2}}, state, index) where {R1,R2,W1,W2}
```

By default the output is written to the current cell in the specified `W` write grid/s.
`Rule`s writing to multiple grids, simply return a `Tuple` in the order specified by
the `W` type params.

## Rule Performance

Rules may run many millions of times during a simulation. They need to be fast. 
Some basic guidlines for writing rules are:

- Never allocate memory in a `Rule` if you can help it.
- Type stability is essential. [`isinferred`](@ref) is useful to check
    if your rule is type-stable.
- Using the `@inline` macro on `applyrule` can help force inlining your
    code into the simulation.
- Reading and writing from multiple grids is expensive due to additional load
    on fast cahce memory. Try to limit the number of grids you use.
- Use a graphical profiler, like ProfileView.jl, to check your rules overall 
    performance when run with `sim!`.

"""
    Cellrule <: Rule

A `Rule` that only writes and uses a state from single cell of the read grids,
and has its return value written back to the same cell(s).

This limitation can be useful for performance optimisation,
such as wrapping rules in [`Chain`](@ref) so that no writes occur between rules.


`CellRule` is defined with :

```julia
struct YourCellRule{R,W} <: CellRule{R,W} end
```

And applied as:

```julia
function applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourCellRule{R,W}, state, index) where {R,W}
    state * 2
end
```

As the `index` is provided in `applyrule`, you can look up an [`aux`](@ref) array
using `aux(data, Val{:auxname}())[index...]` to access cell-specific variables for
your rule.

It's good to add a struct field to hold the `Val{:auxname}()` object instead of
using names directly, so that users can set the aux name themselves to suit the
scripting context.

    SetCellRule <: Rule

Abstract supertype for rules that can manually write to any cells of the

`SetCellRule` is applied with a method like:

```julia
function applyrule!(data::SimData, rule::YourSetCellRule, state, index)
     inc = 1
     add!(data, inc, index...)
     return nothing
end
```

Note the `!` bang - this method alters the state of `data`.

To update the grid, you can use atomic operators [`add!`](@ref), [`sub!`](@ref),
[`min!`](@ref), [`max!`](@ref), and [`and!`](@ref), [`or!`](@ref) for `Bool`.
These methods safely combined writes from all grid cells - directly using `setindex!`
would cause bugs.

It there are multiple write grids, you will need to get the grid keys from
type parameters, here `W1` and `W2`:

```julia
function applyrule(data, rule::YourSetCellRule{R,Tuple{W1,W2}}, state, index) where {R,W1,W2}
     inc = 1
     add!(data[W1], inc, index...)
     add!(data[W2], 2inc, index...)
     return nothing
end
```

DynamicGrids guarantees that:

- values written to anywhere on the grid do not affect other cells in
    the same rule at the same timestep.
- values written to anywhere on the grid are available to the next rule in the 
    sequence, or the next timestep.
- if atomic operators are always used, race conditions will not occur on any hardware.

    NeighborhoodRule <: Rule

A Rule that only accesses a neighborhood centered around the current cell.
`NeighborhoodRule` is applied with the method:

```julia
applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourNeighborhoodRule, state, I)

`NeighborhoodRule` must have a `neighborhood` field, that holds
a [`Neighborhood`](@ref) object. `neighbors(rule)` returns an iterator
over the surrounding cell pattern defined by the `Neighborhood`.

For each cell in the grids the neighborhood buffer will be updated
for use in the `applyrule` method, managed to minimise array reads.

This allows memory optimisations and the use of high perforance routines on the
neighborhood buffer. It also means that and no bounds checking is required in 
neighborhood code.

For neighborhood rules with multiple read grids, the first is always
the one used for the neighborhood, the others are passed in as additional
state for the cell. Any grids can be written to, but only for the current cell.

Returned value(s) are written to the `write`/`W` grid.

As with all [`NeighborhoodRule`](@ref), you do not have to check bounds at
grid edges, that is handled for you internally.

Using [`SparseOpt`](@ref) may improve neighborhood performance
when zero values are common and can be safely ignored.
