    Rule

A `Rule` object contains the information required to apply an
`applyrule` method to every cell of every timestep of a simulation.


The [`applyrule`](@ref) method follows the form:

```julia
@inline applyrule(data::AbstractSimData, rule::MyRule, state, I::Tuple{Int,Int}) = ...
```

Where `I` is the cell index, and `state` is a single value, or a `NamedTuple`
if multiple grids are requested. the [`AbstractSimData`](@ref) object can be used to access 
current timestep and other simulation data and metadata.

Rules can be updated from the original rule before each timestep, in [`modifyrule`](@ref).
Here a paremeter depends on the sum of a grid:

```jldoctest 
using DynamicGrids, Setfield
struct MySummedRule{R,W,T} <: CellRule{R,W}
    gridsum::T
end
function modifyrule(rule::MySummedRule{R,W}, data::AbstractSimData) where {R,W}
    Setfield.@set rule.gridsum = sum(data[R])
end

# output
modifyrule (generic function with 1 method)
```

Rules can also be run in sequence, as a `Tuple` or in a [`Ruleset`](@ref)s.

DynamicGrids guarantees that:

- `modifyrule` is run once for every rule for every timestep.
    The result is passed to `applyrule`, but not retained after that.
- `applyrule` is run once for every rule, for every cell, for every timestep, unless an
    optimisation like [`SparseOpt`](@ref) is used to skip empty cells.
- the output of running a rule for any cell does not affect the input of the
    same rule running anywhere else in the grid.
- rules later in the sequence are passed grid state updated by the earlier rules.
- masked areas, and wrapped or removed `boundary` regions are updated between rules when
    they have changed.

## Multiple grids

The keys of the init `NamedTuple` will be match the grid keys used in `R` and `W` for each
rule, which is a type like `Tuple{:key1,:key1}`. Note that the names are user-specified,
and should never be fixed by a `Rule`.

Read grid names are retrieved from the type here as `R1` and `R2`, while write grids are
`W1` and `W2`.

```jldoctest
using DynamicGrids
struct MyMultiSetRule{R,W} <: SetCellRule{R,W} end
function applyrule(
    data::AbstractSimData, rule::MyMultiSetRule{Tuple{R1,R2},Tuple{W1,W2}}, (r1, r2), I
) where {R1,R2,W1,W2}
    add!(data[W1], 1, I) 
    add!(data[W2], 1, I) 
end

# output
applyrule (generic function with 1 method)
```

The return value of an `applyrule` is written to the current cell in the specified `W`
write grid/s. `Rule`s writing to multiple grids simply return a `Tuple` in the order
specified by the `W` type params.

## Rule Performance

Rules may run many millions of times during a simulation. They need to be fast.
Some basic guidlines for writing rules are:

- Never allocate memory in a `Rule` if you can help it.
- Type stability is essential. [`isinferred`](@ref) is useful to check
    if your rule is type-stable.
- Using the `@inline` macro on `applyrule` can help force inlining your
    code into the simulation.
- Reading and writing from multiple grids is expensive due to additional load
    on fast cahce memory. Try to limit the number of grids you use.
- Use a graphical profiler, like ProfileView.jl, to check your rules overall
    performance when run with `sim!`.

A `Rule` that only writes and uses a state from single cell of the read grids,
and has its return value written back to the same cell(s).

This limitation can be useful for performance optimisation,
such as wrapping rules in [`Chain`](@ref) so that no writes occur between rules.

`CellRule` is defined with :

```jldoctest yourcellrule
using DynamicGrids
struct MyCellRule{R,W} <: CellRule{R,W} end

And applied as:

```jldoctest yourcellrule

"""
    Call <: CellRule

    Cell(f)
    Cell{R,W}(f)

A [`CellRule`](@ref) that applies a function `f` to the `R` grid value, 
or `Tuple` of values, and returns the `W` grid value or `Tuple` of values.

Especially convenient with `do` notation.

## Example

Double the cell value in grid `:a`:

```jldoctest Cell
using DynamicGrids
simplerule = Cell{:a}() do data, a, I
    2a
end
# output
Cell{:a,:a}(
    f = var"#1#2"
)
```

`data` is an [`AbstractSimData`](@ref) object, `a` is the cell value, and `I`
is a `Tuple` holding the cell index.

If you need to use multiple grids (a and b), use the `R`
and `W` type parameters. If you want to use external variables,
wrap the whole thing in a `let` block, for performance. This
rule sets the new value of `b` to the value of `a` to `b` times scalar `y`:

```jldoctest Cell
y = 0.7
rule = let y = y
    rule = Cell{Tuple{:a,:b},:b}() do data, (a, b), I
        a + b * y

"""
    SetCellRule <: Rule

Abstract supertype for rules that can manually write to any cells of the

For example, `SetCellRule` is applied with like this, here simply adding 1 to the current cell:

using DynamicGrids
struct MySetCellRule{R,W} <: SetCellRule{R,W} end

function applyrule!(data::AbstractSimData, rule::MySetCellRule{R,W}, state, I) where {R,W}

    isinbounds && add!(data[W], 1, I...)
    return nothing
end
# output
applyrule! (generic function with 1 method)
```

Note the `!` bang - this method alters the state of `data`.

To update the grid, you can use atomic operators [`add!`](@ref), [`sub!`](@ref),
[`min!`](@ref), [`max!`](@ref), and [`and!`](@ref), [`or!`](@ref) for `Bool`.
These methods safely combined writes from all grid cells - directly using `setindex!`
would cause bugs.

It there are multiple write grids, you will need to get the grid keys from
type parameters, here `W1` and `W2`:

```jldoctest SetCellRule
function applyrule(data, rule::MySetCellRule{R,Tuple{W1,W2}}, state, I) where {R,W1,W2}
    add!(data[W1], 1, I...)
    add!(data[W2], 2, I...)
    return nothing
end
# output

```

DynamicGrids guarantees that:

- values written to anywhere on the grid do not affect other cells in
    the same rule at the same timestep.
- values written to anywhere on the grid are available to the next rule in the
    sequence, or in the next timestep if there are no remaining rules.
- if atomic operators like `add!` and `sub!` are always used to write to the grid,
    race conditions will not occur on any hardware.

states for the cell and a `Tuple{Int,Int}` index of the current cell.

A Rule that only accesses a neighborhood centered around the current cell.
`NeighborhoodRule` is applied with the method:

```julia
applyrule(data::AbstractSimData, rule::MyNeighborhoodRule, state, I::Tuple{Int,Int})
```

`NeighborhoodRule` must have a `neighborhood` method or field, that holds
a [`Neighborhood`](@ref) object. `neighbors(rule)` returns an iterator
over the surrounding cell pattern defined by the `Neighborhood`.

For each cell in the grids the neighborhood buffer will be updated
for use in the `applyrule` method, managed to minimise array reads.

This allows memory optimisations and the use of high-perforance routines on the
neighborhood buffer. It also means that and no bounds checking is required in
neighborhood code.

For neighborhood rules with multiple read grids, the first is always
the one used for the neighborhood, the others are passed in as additional
state for the cell. Any grids can be written to, but only for the current cell.

A [`NeighborhoodRule`](@ref) that runs a convolution kernel over the grid.

`kernel` must be a square matrix.

## Performance

Small radius convolutions in DynamicGrids.jl will be comparable or even faster than using
DSP.jl or ImageConvolutions.jl. As the radius increases these packages will be a lot faster.

But `Convolution` is convenient to chain into a simulation, and combined with some other
rules. It should perform reasonably well with all but very large kernels.

Values are not normalised, so make sure the kernel sums to `1` if you need that.

Directly using `setindex!` is possible, but may cause bugs as multiple cells
may write to the same location in an unpredicatble order. As a rule, directly
setting a neighborhood index should only be done if it always sets the samevalue -
