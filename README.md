DynamicGrids is a generalised framework for building high-performance grid-based
spatial simulations, including cellular automata, but also allowing a wider
range of behaviours like random jumps and interactions between multiple grids.
It is extended by [Dispersal.jl](https://github.com/cesaraustralia/Dispersal.jl)
for modelling organism dispersal processes.

A DynamicGrids.jl simulation is run with a script like this one
running the included game of life model `Life()`:

```julia
using DynamicGrids, Crayons

init = rand(Bool, 150, 200)
output = REPLOutput(init; tspan=1:200, fps=30, color=Crayon(foreground=:red, background=:black, bold=true))
sim!(output, Life())

# Or define it from scratch (yes this is actually the whole implementation!)
const sum_states = (false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false), 
                   (false, false, true, true,  false, false, false, false, false)
life = Neighbors(Moore(1)) do hood, state
    sum_states[state + 1][sum(hood) + 1]
end
sim!(output, life)
```

# Concepts

The framework is highly customisable, but there are some central ideas that define
how a simulation works: *grids*, *rules*, and *outputs*.

## Grids

Simulation grids may be any single `AbstractArray` or a `NamedTuple` of multiple
`AbstractArray`. Usually grids contain values of `Number`, but other types are possible.
Grids are updated by `Rule`s that are run for every cell, at every timestep. 

The `init` grid/s contain whatever initialisation data is required to start
a simulation: the array type, size and element type, as well as providing the
initial conditions:

```juli
init = rand(Float32, 100, 100)
```

An `init` grid can be attached to an `Output`: 

```
output = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:100)
```

or passed in to `sim!`, where it will take preference over the `init`
attached to the `Output`, but must be the same type and size:

```
sim!(output, ruleset; init=init)
```

For multiple grids, `init` is a `NamedTuple` of equal-sized arrays
matching the names given to each `Ruleset` :

```julia
init = (predator=rand(100, 100), prey=(rand(100, 100))
```

Handling and passing of the correct grids to a `Rule` is automated by
DynamicGrids.jl. `Rule`s specify which grids they require in what order using
the first two (`R` and `W`) type parameters.

Dimensional or spatial `init` grids from
[DimensionalData.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/DimensionalData.jl) or
[GeoData.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/GeoData.jl) will propagate through the
model to return output with explicit dimensions. This will plot correctly as a
map using [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl), to which shape
files and observation points can be easily added.

### Non-Number Grids

Grids containing custom and non-`Number` types are possible, with some caveats.
They must define `Base.zero` for their element type, and should be a bitstype for performance. 
Tuple does not define `zero`. `Array` is not a bitstype, and does not define `zero`. 
`SArray` from StaticArrays.jl is both, and can be used as the contents of a grid. 
Custom structs that defne `zero` should also work. 

However, for any multi-values grid element type, you will need to define a method of 
`DynamicGrids.to_rgb` that returns an `ARGB32` for them to work in `ImageOutput`s, and 
`isless` for the `REPLoutput` to work. A definition for multiplication by a scalar `Real` 
and addition are required to use `Convolution` kernels.

## Rules

Rules hold the parameters for running a simulation, and are applied in
`applyrule` method that is called for each of the active cells in the grid.
Rules come in a number of flavours (outlined in the
[docs](https://cesaraustralia.github.io/DynamicGrids.jl/stable/#Rules-1)), which
allow assumptions to be made about running them that can greatly improve
performance. Rules can be collected in a `Ruleset`, with some additional
arguments to control the simulation:

```
ruleset = Ruleset(Life(2, 3); opt=SparseOpt(), proc=CuGPU())
```

Multiple rules can be combined in a `Ruleset` or simply passed to `sim!`. Each rule 
will be run for the whole grid, in sequence, using appropriate optimisations depending 
on the parent types of each rule:

```julia
ruleset = Ruleset(rule1, rule2; timestep=Day(1), opt=SparseOpt(), proc=ThreadedCPU())
```


## Output 

[Outputs](https://cesaraustralia.github.io/DynamicGrids.jl/stable/#Output-1)
are ways of storing or viewing a simulation. They can be used
interchangeably depending on your needs: `ArrayOutput` is a simple storage
structure for high performance-simulations. As with most outputs, it is
initialised with the `init` array, but in this case it also requires the number
of simulation frames to preallocate before the simulation runs.

```julia
output = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:10)
```

The `REPLOutput` shown above is a `GraphicOutput` that can be useful for checking a
simulation when working in a terminal or over ssh:

```julia
output = REPLOutput(init; tspan=1:100)
```

`ImageOutput` is the most complex class of outputs, allowing full color visual
simulations using ColorSchemes.jl. It can also display multiple grids using color 
composites or layouts, as shown above in the quarantine simulation.

[DynamicGridsInteract.jl](https://github.com/cesaraustralia/DynamicGridsInteract.jl)
provides simulation interfaces for use in Juno, Jupyter, web pages or electron
apps, with live interactive control over parameters, using 
[ModelParameters.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/ModelParameters.jl).
[DynamicGridsGtk.jl](https://github.com/cesaraustralia/DynamicGridsGtk.jl) is a
simple graphical output for Gtk. These packages are kept separate to avoid
dependencies when being used in non-graphical simulations. 

Outputs are also easy to write, and high performance applications may benefit
from writing a custom output to reduce memory use, or using `TransformedOuput`. 
Performance of DynamicGrids.jl is dominated by cache interactions, so reducing 
memory use has positive effects.

## Example

This example implements a very simple forest fire model:

```julia
using DynamicGrids, DynamicGridsGtk, ColorSchemes, Colors

const DEAD, ALIVE, BURNING = 1, 2, 3

rule = let prob_combustion=0.0001, prob_regrowth=0.01
    Neighbors(Moore(1)) do neighborhood, cell
        if cell == ALIVE
            if BURNING in neighborhood
                BURNING
            else
                rand() <= prob_combustion ? BURNING : ALIVE
            end
        elseif cell == BURNING
            DEAD
        else
            rand() <= prob_regrowth ? ALIVE : DEAD
        end
    end
end

# Set up the init array and output (using a Gtk window)
init = fill(ALIVE, 400, 400)
processor = ColorProcessor(scheme=ColorSchemes.rainbow, zerocolor=RGB24(0.0))
output = GtkOutput(init; tspan=1:200, fps=25, minval=DEAD, maxval=BURNING, processor=processor)

# Run the simulation
sim!(output, rule)

# Save the output as a gif
savegif("forestfire.gif", output)
```

Timing the simulation for 200 steps, the performance is quite good:

```julia
output = ArrayOutput(init; tspan=1:200)
@time sim!(output, ruleset)
 1.384755 seconds (640 allocations: 2.569 MiB)
```

## Alternatives

[Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl) can also do cellular-automata style simulations. The design of Agents.jl is to iterate over a list of agents, instead of broadcasting over an array of cells. This approach is well suited to when you need to track the movement and details about individual agents throughout the simulation. 

However, for simple grid models where you don't need to track individuals, DynamicGrids.jl is orders of magnitude faster than Agents.jl, and usually requires much less code to define a model. For low density simulations like the forest fire model above (especially with some optimisations and threading turned on), it can be an order of magnitude faster, while for higher activity rules like the game of life on a randomised grid, it is two to three, even four order of magnitude faster, increasing with grid size. If you are doing grid-based simulation and you don't need to track individual agents, DynamicGrids.jl is probably the best tool. For other use cases where you need to track individuals, try Agents.jl.
